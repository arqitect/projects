# Mushroom Cultivation

## Goals

A budget-friendly and beginner-friendly method for DIY mushroom cultivation using pre-cooked rice bags.

## Method: Pre-cooked Rice Bag Tek ("Uncle Ben's Tek")

This method is a popular and accessible way for beginners to start cultivating mushrooms. It minimizes the need for specialized equipment and sterile procedures.

### Materials

*   **Pre-cooked brown rice bags:** (e.g., Uncle Ben's Ready Rice). Choose plain, whole-grain brown rice with no added flavors.
*   **Mushroom spore syringe or liquid culture syringe:** Contains the mushroom spores or mycelium.
*   **70% isopropyl alcohol:** For sterilization.
*   **Micropore tape:** For covering inoculation points and allowing for gas exchange.
*   **Lighter or small torch:** For flame-sterilizing the syringe needle.
*   **Gloves and a face mask:** (Optional but recommended) To minimize contamination.
*   **Still Air Box (SAB) or flow hood:** (Optional but highly recommended) To create a sterile environment for inoculation.

### Step-by-Step Guide

**1. Preparation and Inoculation**

*   **Clean your workspace:** Wipe down all surfaces with 70% isopropyl alcohol.
*   **Personal hygiene:** Wash your hands and wear gloves and a face mask.
*   **Prepare the rice bag:** Wipe the exterior of the rice bag with isopropyl alcohol.
*   **Sterilize the syringe needle:** Heat the needle with a lighter until it glows red-hot, then let it cool for 10-15 seconds.
*   **Inoculation:**
    *   **Option 1 (Corner Cut):** Cut a small corner off the top of the rice bag and immediately cover the opening with micropore tape.
    *   **Option 2 (Direct Injection):** Inject 0.5-2 mL of the spore solution or liquid culture directly through the plastic of the rice bag. Immediately cover the injection site with micropore tape.

**2. Colonization (Incubation)**

*   **Incubation conditions:** Place the inoculated rice bags in a warm, dark area, ideally between 22-27°C (72-80°F).
*   **Monitoring progress:** Colonization typically takes 2-4 weeks. Look for the growth of white mycelium through the clear bottom of the bag.
*   **Break and shake (optional):** Gently break up the rice and shake the bag to distribute the mycelium and speed up colonization.

**3. Fruiting (Harvesting Mushrooms)**

Once the rice bag is fully colonized, you have two main options:

*   **Fruiting directly from the bag:**
    *   Cut a hole in the side or top of the bag.
    *   Maintain high humidity and fresh air exchange by misting and fanning the bag daily.
    *   Provide indirect light.
*   **Spawning to a bulk substrate:**
    *   For larger yields, mix the colonized rice with a pasteurized substrate (like coconut coir) in a larger container.
    *   Maintain high humidity, fresh air exchange, and indirect light.
