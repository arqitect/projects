# DIY Mushroom Cultivation Plan: The Ready Rice Method

**Disclaimer:** This guide is for educational purposes only. Please be aware of the laws in your area regarding the cultivation of mushrooms. Some species may be illegal to grow.

This plan focuses on a budget-friendly and beginner-friendly method using pre-cooked rice bags.

## I. Materials Needed

### Core Supplies:
*   **Spore Syringe or Liquid Culture:** 10-12cc syringe for your chosen mushroom species.
*   **Pre-cooked Rice Bags:** 3-4 bags of ready-to-eat brown rice (e.g., Uncle Ben's). Avoid bags with high sodium or other preservatives.
*   **Micropore Tape:** Also known as surgical tape.
*   **70% Isopropyl Alcohol:** For sterilization.
*   **Disposable Gloves:** To maintain a sterile environment.
*   **Lighter or Alcohol Lamp:** For sterilizing the syringe needle.
*   **Still Air Box (SAB) or Clean Space:** A large, clear plastic bin with armholes cut out, or a very clean, draft-free room.

### For Fruiting:
*   **Plastic Tub with Lid (6-12 qt.):** This will be your fruiting chamber.
*   **Substrate:** Coco coir is a popular and cheap choice. You can buy it in compressed bricks.
*   **Bucket:** For hydrating the coco coir.
*   **Spray Bottle:** For misting.

## II. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Inoculation (Adding Spores to Rice)

**Goal:** Introduce your mushroom spores into the sterile rice bags.

1.  **Prepare Your Workspace:**
    *   If using a SAB, wipe down the inside with alcohol.
    *   If not using a SAB, choose a small room with minimal air flow (like a bathroom). Close doors and windows, and turn off any fans or AC.
    *   Wipe down all your supplies (rice bags, syringe, scissors) with alcohol and place them in your workspace.
    *   Wash your hands and put on your gloves. Wipe your gloved hands with alcohol.

2.  **Inoculate the Rice Bags:**
    *   Shake the spore syringe vigorously to break up the spore clumps.
    *   Flame-sterilize the needle of the syringe with a lighter until it glows red-hot. Let it cool for a few seconds. Do not touch it.
    *   Wipe the front of the rice bag with alcohol.
    *   Carefully inject 0.5-1cc of the spore solution into the bottom part of the rice bag, through the plastic.
    *   Cover the injection hole with a piece of micropore tape. This allows for gas exchange while keeping contaminants out.
    *   (Optional "Gas Exchange" port) Cut a small corner off the top of the bag and immediately cover the opening with micropore tape. This can help speed up colonization.

### Step 2: Colonization (Mycelium Growth)

**Goal:** Let the mycelium (the white, root-like network) fully colonize the rice.

1.  **Storage:**
    *   Place the inoculated bags in a clean, dark place with a consistent temperature between 75-80°F (24-27°C). A closet or a drawer works well.
    *   Do not disturb them for the first week.

2.  **Check for Growth:**
    *   After 7-10 days, you should see the first signs of white mycelial growth.
    *   Handle the bags as little as possible to avoid contamination.
    *   If you see any colors other than white (green, black, pink), that bag is contaminated and should be discarded.

3.  **Break and Shake:**
    *   When the bag is about 20-30% colonized, gently break up the mycelium and mix it with the uncolonized rice. This will speed up the process.
    *   Allow the bag to fully colonize. This can take anywhere from 2 to 4 weeks. The bag should feel firm and be completely white.

### Step 3: Spawning to Bulk (Moving to the Fruiting Chamber)

**Goal:** Mix the colonized rice with a bulk substrate to create a larger surface area for mushrooms to grow.

1.  **Prepare the Substrate:**
    *   Place a brick of coco coir in the bucket.
    *   Boil water and pour it over the coir. The coir will expand. Let it cool completely.
    *   Squeeze the coir to "field capacity" - when you squeeze a handful, only a few drops of water should come out.

2.  **Mix:**
    *   Clean your fruiting chamber, your hands, and your gloves with alcohol.
    *   Open your fully colonized rice bags. It should smell earthy and mushroom-like.
    *   Crumble the colonized rice into the tub.
    *   Add the prepared coco coir and mix thoroughly. A good ratio is 1 part colonized rice to 1-2 parts coir.
    *   Level the surface of the mixture.

3.  **Incubate:**
    *   Close the lid of the tub and place it in the same dark, warm spot where you colonized your rice bags.
    *   Let it sit for 7-10 days. The mycelium will colonize the coir.

### Step 4: Fruiting

**Goal:** Trigger the mycelium to produce mushrooms.

1.  **Introduce Fruiting Conditions:**
    *   **Light:** Move the tub to a location with indirect light. A room with a window is fine, but don't put it in direct sunlight.
    *   **Fresh Air Exchange (FAE):** Fan the tub with the lid 2-3 times a day. You can also flip the lid upside down to create a small gap for air exchange.
    *   **Humidity:** Mist the sides of the tub with your spray bottle 1-2 times a day. You want to see condensation on the walls, but not large water droplets on the surface of the substrate.

2.  **Pinning:**
    *   After 5-12 days, you should see tiny "pins" forming. These are baby mushrooms.

### Step 5: Harvesting

**Goal:** Harvest your mushrooms at the right time.

1.  **When to Harvest:**
    *   The best time to harvest is right before or just as the veil (the thin membrane under the cap) breaks.
    *   Harvest by gently twisting and pulling the mushroom from the base.

2.  **Subsequent Flushes:**
    *   After you harvest all the mushrooms, you can get more "flushes" (crops).
    *   Soak the substrate in water for a few hours, drain the excess water, and then return to fruiting conditions.
    *   You can typically get 2-4 flushes from one tub.

## III. Troubleshooting

*   **Contamination:** If you see any mold, discard the bag or tub immediately to prevent it from spreading.
*   **Slow Growth:** This is usually due to low temperatures.
*   **No Pins:** This can be caused by not enough humidity or fresh air.
